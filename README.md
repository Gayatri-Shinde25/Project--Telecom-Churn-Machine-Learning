# Telecom-Churn-Machine-Learning
Introduction: When it comes to useful business applications of machine learning, it doesn’t get much better than customer churn prediction. It’s a problem where you usually have a lot of high-quality, fresh data to work with, it’s relatively straightforward, and solving it can be a great way to increase profits. The churn rate is a critical metric of customer satisfaction. Low churn rates mean happy customers; high churn rates mean customers are leaving you. A small rate of monthly/quarterly churn compounds over time. 1% monthly churn quickly translates to almost 12% yearly churn. Thanks to ML, forecasting customer churn with the help of machine learning is possible. Machine learning and data analysis are powerful ways to identify and predict churn. During churn prediction, you’re also:
•	Identifying at-risk customers,
•	Identifying customer pain points,
•	Identifying strategy/methods to lower churn and increase customer retention.
